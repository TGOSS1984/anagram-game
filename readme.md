## Description

### User Experience

Anagram Jam delivers a clean, engaging, and responsive experience designed for players of all ages and skill levels. The intuitive interface presents players with letter tiles in a Scrabble-inspired layout, encouraging them to form real English words through clever thinking and pattern recognition. With difficulty levels ranging from easy to very hard, the game provides a steady learning curve and replayability. Visual feedback such as score tracking, animated tile displays, and clear result indicators enhance user interaction, while accessible design elements like keyboard focus support and mobile responsiveness ensure a seamless experience across all devices.

## Features

### Main Features

- **The Anagram Jam main logo & Heading**
    - Featured at the top of the page,  easy to see for the user and styled like the tiles from the game scrabble to elecit the feeling of playing a word game
    - Due to the fact that the heading was created to look like each letter is a tile, the heading was not built in the traditional way using a 'h' element
- **The Game Area**   
    - Multiple Difficulty Levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, Very Hard
    - Click 'Start Game' for Random Anagram sets: Each game is different
- **The Puzzle Section**
    - Round Counter to let user know which number of round they are currently in (out of 10)
    - Scrabble-style tiles: Both on the header & the game itself for fun reference to scrabble & some visual engagement with the tiles flipping to reveal the word
    - Enter Guess button to submit the answer (can also be submitted by hitting Enter on the keyboard by using event listener)
    - Score Tracking: Tracks score out 10
- **Feedback Area**
    - Lets the user know whether or not they answered correctly and returns a tick or cross depending on the outcome along with some possible answers if answer provided is incorrect
    
- **Responsive Design: Suitable to play on destop, tablet & mobile**

#### How to Play?

- Choose a difficulty Level
- After starting game an anagram base word appears using letter tiles
- Type in a valid anagram of that word (not using the base word)
- Get feedback instantly - green circle with tick if correct , red circle with cross if incorrect
- Complete all 10 rounds and see your final score

### Features for future Development
 
 - Timed mode with countdown
 - Leaderboard integration (maybe add database)
 - Accessibility enhancements
 - Sound Effects


### Design

- The design was initally conceptualised using Wireframes
- The idea was to create a one page, simple website that clearly references word games



#### Main Colours used

Use of beige, Greens, browns were used to tie in with not only scrabble pieces but also the background image used for the website. The website [Image Color Picker](https://imagecolorpicker.com/) was used to do this


#### Font

Main fonts used were 'Liber Baskerville' & 'Bitter'.
Liber Baskerville was used to give the the traditional word game feel on all headers
Bitter was used for the game area to provide a clean, modern aesthetic


## Deployment

**Used VSCode to build & GitHub for deployment of the website.**

- **VSCode**
    - Code was written in VSCode.
    - html & readme.md were added to the main folder and a sub-folder was created named assests wherein images/css style sheet & Javascipt were kept

- **GitHub**
    - A GitHub account was created
    - A new reposiory was created on GitHub by clicking the 'New' button. It was named and set as public.  
    - A folder was created in VSCode and initialised as a Git repository
    - In VSCode the terminal was used to run commands to link the local project to the GitHub repository
    - Throughout the process of builing the website, commits & pushes were staged regularly using terminal commands such as 'git add .' , 'git-commit -m' & 'git push'
    - Host the project: Went to my GitHub repository, clicked settings > pages and selected the branch to publish, hit save and then GitHub generated a live link (link at top of readme)

## Testing

### Browser and Device Testing

[Browserstack](https://www.browserstack.com/?utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_platform=paidads&utm_content=&utm_campaign=Bing-Search-Brand-Tier1-EMEA-CL&utm_campaigncode=BrowserStack-Alpha+41752&utm_term=e+browserstack&msclkid=3d18b644641d13bfb677d1ae33798480) was used to test the site on multiple browsers on desktop and mobile.

| Browser | Device | Outcome of testing? |
|----------|----------|----------|
| p | p | p |
| p| p | p |
| p | p | p |

### Lighthouse Tests

Lighthouse Homepage test results - 



**General Site Testing**

- I checked that the site was fully responsive on multiple screen types using not only browserstack but also devtools device toolbar once deployed to github pages
- I confirmed that the all buttons worked correctly (start game would the show the game area), submit would show if the answer was correct/incorrect once deployed to github pages
- I confirmed that the round and score counters worked as expected & that the 'Game Complete' showed once all ten rounds are over with an overall score once deployed to github pages
- Many of the Javascript solved bugs mentioned below were tested using devtools debugger & JSHint

### Solved Bugs

- General Bugs
    - There were many occasions when the javascript just did not work as expected and I used JSHint to help with this. The most common errors I found where syntax errors where I had missed the following ; / {} / [] 

- Game Logic Bugs:
    - When I was testing the code , intially I didnt include 'usedSets' so this meant that some words would appear twice, this was fixed by adding
    - Currently when the user types the same base word this gives the message 'That's the base word! Try a different anagram'. This could be seen as confusing or exploitable.
- UI & Flip Animation glitch:
    - Initially I tried to add an extra wrapper element for the tile flip animation, this caused the layout to break, which meant tiles did not wrap properly, this was fixed by ensuring the extra CSS existed in the .tile element
    - Because I was using bootstrap and classes like .row & .d-flex there were sometimes overlaps when used in the wrong places which caused issues with the UX
- Accessibility & Keyboard Bugs:
    - When first testing with Lighthouse I got a lower than expected accessibility score, this was because aria labels had been missed or added incorrectly to certain elements, once fixed the score was much improved
    - When first testing the game I inherently pressed enter to submit an answer, when this did not work I decided that I should implement an event listener for a key press. At first though I did add the call to checkGuess() whihc meant that this did nto work. Once added this corrected the issue
    - As the game area starts as hidden using display:none, I decided to add a focus() into the JS to ensure better user experience - this was discovered after I first tested the code
- Resource Paths & Deployment errors:
    - When I first deployed the site in gitpages I realised that all images used where not visible, I had to change the image file paths to fix this
